# Manage Questions

Questions form the structure of a CiviForm program. When a CiviForm Admin creates a question for one of their forms, the question is saved in the global question bank. When programs reuse the same question, all Applicant data related to the question gets autofilled. This reduces duplicate data entry and ensures accuracy by using previously vetted information.

### Create a question
Watch the video or follow the step-by-step guide below.

{% embed url="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W6qisNemjmm-HBRlHTiohQls2oA9Q_Hz/view?usp=sharing" %} Create new questions in the shared question bank. {% endembed %}

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Questions** on the navigation bar.
3. Click **Create new question** and select a question type.\
   For more details on question types, go to [Question types](manage-questions.md#question-types).
4. Enter the information for the question.
5. Click **Create**.\
   The new question appears in the list of questions.

**Tip**: You might want to develop a naming convention for your questions. For example, address-residence, address-work, etc.

### Question Export Settings

When a CiviForm Admin creates a question, they must choose an export setting. The export setting controls whether data will be exported in the demography CSV, which is the CiviForm Admin's exported data. The export setting does not affect the Program Admin's exported data. The CiviForm Admin selects one of the following data export options:

**Don't allow answers to be exported** - the answer won't appear in any way in the exported data.

**Export exact answers** - the raw answer as provided by the applicant will appear in the exported data.

**Export obfuscated answers** - the raw answer as provided by the applicant will not appear in the exported data, and instead, an "obfuscated" answer will appear. Obfuscated means that the applicant's answer to the question is cryptographically obscured, exporting text that is unique to the applicant's answer but does not reveal what the original text was. It is impossible to derive the applicant's original input from the resulting exported value. Only other questions with the exact same answer will have the same exported value. 

For example, in a social security number question, the following inputs would result in the corresponding outputs: 

Input: 123-45-6789 Example obfuscated output: d158596dd5a6cae6fcb282832885631553ecc8c8b0bf07f84c4aa691953cd0da 

Input: 123-45-6780 Example obfuscated output: 01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b

### Edit a question

You can edit both unpublished and published questions. To edit published questions, you need a new version. For more details on versioning, go to [Manage versions for programs & questions.](manage-versions-for-programs-and-questions.md)

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Questions** on the navigation bar and select a question.
3. Click **Edit draft**.
4. Modify the question information fields.
5. Click **Update**.

### Archive a question

If a question is no longer in use by any program, you can archive a question.

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Questions** on the navigation bar and select a question.
3. Click **Archive**.

### Restore an archived question

When you restore an archived question, you can use it in your programs. You can restore an archived question up until the next version is published. For more details on versioning, go to [Manage versions for programs & questions.](manage-versions-for-programs-and-questions.md)

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Questions** on the navigation bar and select an archived question.
3. Click **Restore archived**.

### Question types

You can customize your program to include multiple different question types. The table below shows the supported question types, along with the expected data input.

| **Type**     | **Use case and expected data**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
