# Releasing

See [Upgrading to a New Release](it-manual/sre-playbook/upgrading-to-a-new-release.md) for an overview of CiviForm release practices.

Releases are created weekly by the on-call engineer on Wednesday before 12pm. The on-call engineer may use the production meeting time to create the release if desired. Out-of-schedule releases may be created if requested by a civic entity (e.g. for an urgent bugfix).

New releases go through a QA process that takes them from a draft state to fully published. The QA process is best-effort for official release images, and may be skipped if resources are not available.

## Creating a new release

### 1. Find the most recent commit that is passing CI for all staging environments:

Find the commit SNAPSHOT id from one of the following, and extract the SHA from it. The SHA is the middle item in the SNAPSHOT-sha-hash ID. For example for `SNAPSHOT-fa971bb-1666156765` ID the commit SHA is `fa971bb`.

NOTE: If the last successful snapshot for ALL environments is not the most recent one, contact a Seattle software engineer to request that they deploy the release candidate to their staging environment.

#### From Deployment-bot

Check the #deployment-bot Slack channel for the latest successful SNAPSHOT for AWS, Seattle, and Azure. This offers a history of previous auto pushes too.

#### From Staging servers

On the running servers inspect the DOM tree for `<head><meta name="civiform-build-tag">`. Its `content` attribute will only show the current SNAPSHOT for each though.

* [staging-azure](https://staging-azure.civiform.dev/)
* [staging-AWS](https://staging-aws.civiform.dev/)
* [Seattle staging](https://staging.seattle.civiform.com/)

### 2. Run the script to create a new draft release

You'll need to determine:

* Commit SHA: This is the middle item in the SNAPSHOT-sha-hash ID from Step 1
* Release number: Pick the next minor number (1.X.0) since the [last release](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/releases)

Setup:
* Login to docker as the civiform user. If you don't have the password ask the #github-maintainers Slack channel
* Generate a GH access token and provide it as [documented](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/blob/main/bin/create-release#L14).

When ready run [create-release](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/blob/main/bin/create-release) script:
```shell
bin/create-release SHA vNumber
```

If the script fails due to missing `requests` library. Try the following:
```shell
python3 -m ensurepip
pip3 install requests --user
```

The release script will then:

1. Validates the commit SHA is a commit on main and RELEASE_NUMBER matches the convention
1. Tags the git commit with the release number, annotated with description that includes the email address of the release caller, and pushes it to github
1. Pulls the existing server image from Docker Hub (identified by the commit SHA), tags it with the release number and pushes it to Docker Hub
1. Calls the GitHub API to create a new draft release
1. Prints the GH URL to the draft release


### 3. Edit the generated draft release

Follow the GitHub URL to the draft release printed at the end of the script from the previous step, or navigate to [the repo's releases page](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/releases) and find the new draft release.

Next, edit the release notes to include the following:

- Description of fixed bugs
- Description of new features
- Database schema changes
- Other stateful changes (such as stored file key name schema)
- API version changes and deprecation notices
- New configuration values
- Infrastructure changes
- Dependency changes (for the server only) including new, removed, and version updates

Every pull request that is relevant to the release should have a `Release notes` section in its description, use this if the autogenerated description for a given PR is not adequate.

### 4. Notify QA of the new release candidate

Message Matthew Sprenke (City of Seattle) in the `#release-discussion` channel on Slack, notifying QA that a new release candidate is ready for review. Make sure to do this AFTER Seattle has deployed the release candidate to staging if it is not the most recent snapshot.

```
A new draft release vX.X.X is ready for testing. Release notes can be found here: [INSERT LINK TO GITHUB DRAFT RELEASE HERE].
Draft release is available on the following stagings:
https://staging.seattle.civiform.com/
https://staging-aws.civiform.dev/

Please perform necessary QA checks before EOD Wed [INSERT DATE] PT time. If you find any issues with the release - reply to this announcement.

Folks to notify: @Matthew Sprenke
```

Wait until Matthew provides feedback on the release to proceed to step 5, do not proceed if he reports any blocking issues with the release candidate.

If Matthew is not available, recruit engineers, PMs, and other contributors to evaluate the release candidate. Direct them to specific areas of interest based on the release notes and the QA test plan.

### 5. Publish the release and email all stakeholders

Once the release notes are looking good, publish the draft release and then email the release notes to civiform-announce@googlegroups.com
