# Manage Programs

A CiviForm program is a benefits program built by CiviForm Admins. It’s essentially a vehicle to ask questions of program Applicants and to collect completed applications. Once you create a program, you’ll need to publish it to make it available.

**Tip**: To retrieve a list of all programs, click **Download Exported Data (CSV)** at the bottom of the Programs page.

### Create a program

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Programs** on the navigation bar.
3. Click **Create new program**.
4. Enter information for the program, including the external link for additional program information.
5. Click **Save**.\
   The new program appears in the list of programs.

**Note**: The internal Program Name field ensures each program is distinct. Once the field is set, it cannot be edited.

### Edit a program

You can edit both unpublished and published programs. To edit published programs, you need a new version. For more details on versioning, go to [Manage versions for programs & questions.](manage-versions-for-programs-and-questions.md)

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Programs** on the navigation bar and select a program you created.
3. Click **Edit**.
4. Modify the program information fields.
5. Click **Save**.

### Publish all draft programs

Once a program is created or a new version is launched, the program remains in draft until published. When published, it’s available to both Trusted Intermediaries and Applicants.

There can only be one unpublished version in the system at a time and once a version is published, it’s locked and cannot be modified. For more details on versioning, go to [Manage versions for programs & questions.](manage-versions-for-programs-and-questions.md)

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Programs** on the navigation bar.
3. Click **Publish all drafts**.\
   Any new or versioned program is now available.
