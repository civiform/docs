### Add a question to a screen

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Programs** on the navigation bar and select a program.
3. Click **Edit** > **Manage questions**.
4. Add a question to a screen by selecting it from the question bank.\
   The question appears within the screen.

**Note**: Enumerator or file upload questions must be the only questions on a screen. These question types cannot coexist with others. For example, if you add one of these questions to an empty screen, you can't add any other question types. If you have a screen that already has a question, you can't add an enumerator or file upload question to the screen.

### Remove a question from a screen

2. Click **Programs** on the navigation bar and select a program.
3. Click **Edit** > **Manage questions**.

   The question is removed from the screen and it returns to the question bank.
### Reorder screens

If you have more than one screen in your program, you can organize the screens within the screen tree.

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Programs** on the navigation bar and select a program.
3. Click **Edit** > **Manage questions**.
4. To reorder the list, select the screen you want to move and click the up or down arrow.

### Remove a screen

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Programs** on the navigation bar and select a program.
3. Click **Edit** > **Manage questions**.
4. Find the screen you want to remove within a program and click **Delete screen**.\
   The screen is removed from the program and the questions return to the question bank.

**Note**: You cannot delete all screens from a program as a program must have at least one screen. Only once your program has more than one screen can you delete the default screen.
