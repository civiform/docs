# HTTP API

CiviForm supports integration with external systems via its HTTP JSON API. The API authenticates requests using API keys managed by the CiviForm admin. API clients can expect [conventional response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) indicating the result of their request.
