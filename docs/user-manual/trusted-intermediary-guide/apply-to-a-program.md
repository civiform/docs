# Apply to a program

Trusted Intermediaries can help residents apply to services or they can alert individual Applicants that programs are open to applications. They can also create profiles for their clients when applying. If the Applicant has applied to programs using CiviForm in the past, and they elected to save their information, CiviForm can reuse the Applicant’s stored information for future applications. \\

CiviForm also allows Trusted Intermediaries to manage multiple clients through the application process. Trusted Intermediary Groups can also view the Applicant data their staff have entered.

**Note**: Before a Trusted Intermediary can sign in, they must be added to a Trusted Intermediary Group by the CiviForm Admin. For more details, go to [Manage Trusted Intermediaries](../civiform-admin-guide/manage-trusted-intermediaries.md).
