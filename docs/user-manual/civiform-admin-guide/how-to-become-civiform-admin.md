{% hint style="info" %} **How do I become a CiviForm Admin?** CiviForm Admins are controlled by an external ADFS group. When a person logs in as admin using ADFS flow - CiviForm checks if the user belongs to the ADFS admin group. If they do - the user gets CiviForm Admin access. ADFS group used for CiviForm admin membership check is specified using `ADFS_GLOBAL_ADMIN_GROUP` variable. More about admin authentication setup in [Authentication Providers guide](../../contributor-guide/developer-guide/authentication-providers.md). {% endhint %}
