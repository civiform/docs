# CiviForm Docs

This is CiviForm's documentation. **[Visit the main website here](https://civiform.us).**

CiviForm is a free, open source tool that makes it easier to access and administer public assistance programs. Residents and community organizations can find and apply to multiple programs in one place, and governments can streamline services and reach communities in need.

In the docs, you will find:

* [Overview of CiviForm](overview/what-is-civiform.md) with a high-level summary on how the tool works for different users
* [Onboarding Guide](user-manual/onboarding-guide) to understand how CiviForm can support your organization's service delivery
* [User Manual](user-manual/civiform-admin-guide/README.md) to set up and manage your programs and applications
* [IT Manual](it-manual/sre-playbook/README.md) to deploy CiviForm on your technical infrastructure
* [Contributor Guide](contributor-guide/developer-guide/technical-contribution-guide.md) to contribute new features
* [Governance & Management Documentation](governance-and-management/governance/) with information on how CiviForm is being collaboratively managed and developed
