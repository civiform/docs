# Communications Guidelines

These are communication guidelines for the Civiform Open Source community. We expect these standards to evolve over time.

* **For announcements & recognition → Google Groups.** Why? Emails are accessible and commonly used in government.
* **For tracking work → Github.** Why? Github is our project management tool and should be the source of truth for ongoing work. 
* **For all other communications → Slack.** Why? Slack is accessible to government entities and good for immediate conversations.

## Public Shared Drive
**NOTE**: To start work in a new file, use and rename an existing ‘Untitled Documents’ in the folder. Creating files in an externally owned shared drives using a Google corp account is treated as "migration of files". It appears that this feature is blocked right now. Currently, civiform-fellows and civiform-governance have access to edit files.
