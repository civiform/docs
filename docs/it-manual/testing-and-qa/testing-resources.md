# Testing resources

### Testing resources

Product managers, user experience designers, and others may need to test out CiviForm to see how the product currently looks and works. Recall that there are 4 user types:

* Applicants
* Trusted intermediaries (TIs)
* CiviForm admins
* Program admins

To log in under a specific role, open your staging site (e.g. [demo.civiform.dev](https://demo.civiform.dev)), click the "DevTools" link in the upper right of the page, and select the role you wish to log in as.
