# Push the `website/public` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.
#
# The 'main' branch of this repository is the source of truth for the website content.
#   The gh-pages branch simply exists as a mirror of `website/public` directory  
#   of the `main` branch to serve that site content via GitHub pages.
#   The `gh-pages` branch should never be edited directly, and should always be
#   an exact mirror of the `website/public` directory on the `main` branch.
#   This workflow performs that mirror, which then triggers another action
#   on the `gh-pages` branch that deploys the site content to GitHub Pages.
