# Yes/No questions

Yes/no questions allow CiviForm admin to easily setup and customize a question that requires a yes/no answer.

## Creating and configuring a Yes/No question

To create a Yes/No question, click "Create new question" and then select "Yes/No" from the question type dropdown. Question text, help text, admin id, and note can be added as usual.

Under "Question settings" you'll see four pre-set answer options: "Yes", "No", "Not sure", and "Maybe". "Yes" and "No" are required options and cannot be removed. You can unselect "Not sure" and/or "Maybe" to remove them from the answer options the applicant will see.

## Translations
The pre-set answer options for Yes/No questions come translated out of the box and there is no need to add translations for them. You will still need to translate the question text and help text like with other question types.
