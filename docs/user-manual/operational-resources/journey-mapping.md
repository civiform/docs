# Journey mapping

One strategy for understanding the needs of applicants and program staff in more detail is *journey mapping*. Journey mapping is a way of documenting and understanding the end-to-end experience of applicants and program staff as they engage with the program. A *journey map* can give a high-level overview of key interactions, challenges, and opportunities for improvement for different stakeholders throughout their experience with the program.
