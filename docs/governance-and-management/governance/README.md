# Governance 

CiviForm is free, open-source software that was built by the City of Seattle with support from Google.org Fellows. It is developed and maintained by its community of users and contributors, including civic entities, Google.org Fellows, and a nonprofit project steward. Each government deploys and manages their own instance of CiviForm using the shared codebase. Participants in the CiviForm project are expected to abide by the shared Code of Conduct. Through the collective development and maintenance of best-in-class software, CiviForm aims to expand access to government services to those who need them most. 

The following docs describe the processes and principles by which CiviForm is collectively developed and maintained:

  * [Roles, Committees, & Responsibilities](roles-committees-and-responsibilities.md)
  * [Governance Processes](governance-processes.md)
  * [Development Principles](development-principles.md)
  * [Communication Guidelines](communication.md)
