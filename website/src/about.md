# About CiviForm

Accessing public assistance programs is complicated. Residents must navigate siloed application sites and re-enter sensitive personal information, which can be burdensome and demoralizing. Local program staff and community-based organizations lack the tools necessary to help quickly connect residents to the resources they need most. These problems are only made worse in times of crisis.

CiviForm was built to simplify the way residents find and apply for public assistance programs. When there is no wrong door, government teams can better reach communities in need.

CiviForm is a free, open source software solution for governments that was developed by the City of Seattle with pro bono support from the [Google.org Fellowship program](https://g.co/fellowship). The project is now stewarded by [Exygy](https://www.exygy.com/) and is collectively developed and maintained by the governments that use it.
