# Using enumerator questions & screens in a program

CiviForm contains the enumerator question type that offers CiviForm Admins a specialized way of structuring their data. Repeated questions can be created for enumerator questions, which allows admins to ask the same question for each repeated entity the applicant lists for the enumerator question.

An enumerator screen allows you to create repeated screens with repeated questions in them. In an enumerator screen, the applicant provides a list of repeated entities (for example, household members). Applicants can view each repeated screen for each repeated entity declared in the enumerator screen.

For example, if a program needs to gather name and date of birth information for each of an applicant's children. You can create an enumerator screen with an enumerator question to list the applicant's children, and a repeated screen with the repeated questions for the name and date of birth. You can choose to put both the name and date of birth repeated questions in the same repeated screen, or create two repeated screens with one question in each screen.

Enumerators do not store question data. Instead, each repeated question of the enumerator stores the data. An Applicant's answers to enumerator questions are only used to help Applicants track their answers within the repeated questions.

A screen can only contain an enumerator when it’s the only question on the screen. Repeated screens are created from enumerator screens. An enumerator screen can be a repeated screen of another enumerator. An enumerator screen's repeated screen appears below the enumerator screen and is indented in the tree. Repeated screens display a label showing the screen they were copied from. When adding repeated screens, the enumerator question in the enumerator screen isn’t copied to the repeated screens.
