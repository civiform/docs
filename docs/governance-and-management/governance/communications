# Communications

These are communication guidelines for the Civiform Open Source community. This includes anyone interested in contributing to the open source project. We expect these to evolve over time.

*For announcements & recognition → Google Groups.* Why? Emails are accessible and commonly used in government.
*For tracking work → Github.* Why? Github is our project management tool and should be the source of truth for ongoing work. 
*For all other communications → Slack.* Why? Slack is accessible to government entities and good for immediate conversations.
