# Manage program notifications

By default, CiviForm sends Program Admins an email every time an application is submitted to a program they manage.

To change this:
1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
1. Click **Programs** on the navigation bar.
1. Click **Edit** for the program you would like to edit notification settings for.
1. Under **Email Notifications**, select or unselect **Send Program Admins an email notification every time an application is submitted**.
1. Save and publish the program.
