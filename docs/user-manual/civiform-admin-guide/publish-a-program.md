### Publish all draft programs

Once a program is created or a new version is launched, the program remains in draft until published. When published, it’s available to both Trusted Intermediaries and Applicants.

There can only be one unpublished version in the system at a time and once a version is published, it’s locked and cannot be modified. For more details on versioning, go to [Manage versions for programs & questions.](manage-versions-for-programs-and-questions.md)

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Programs** on the navigation bar.
3. Click **Publish all drafts**.\
   Any new or versioned program is now available.

### Publish a single draft program

Instead of publishing all programs and questions at the same time, you can also publish just a single draft program.

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Programs** on the navigation bar.
3. Locate the draft program you'd like to publish.
4. Click on the three dots that correspond to that program to open the dropdown menu.
5. Click **Publish program**.

If the program has any draft questions, those questions will be published along with the program. However, if the draft questions are also referenced by other programs, the program cannot be published on its own. You can only publish it by publishing all programs as described above under **Publish all draft programs**.
