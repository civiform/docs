# UI contribution guide (HTML/CSS)

If you'd like to help design the user interface (UI) for various Civiform pages and widgets, here's where you'll find key resources and guides.

### High-fidelity mockups (for more design-minded folks)

One way you can contribute to the UI effort is to create high-fidelity, (mostly) pixel-perfect mockups of what various screens should look like. As an example, one contributor made [excellent mockups of part of the application flow](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J\_lXULxwE=/?moveToWidget=3074457357026727270\&cot=14). Once you've created these resources, we'll send them off to our engineering team to help them as they build out the UI.

To get started:

* See instructions on the [UX guide](ux-contribution-guide-mockups.md), especially those around the Miro board.
* On our [tracking spreadsheet](http://tiny.cc/cvf-ux-tracker), find a row that doesn't have an entry in the "Hi-fi mock" column.
* Create a mockup for it in our Miro board: [tiny.cc/cvf-flow](http://tiny.cc/cvf-flow)
* [Copy the link to the mockup](https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017572354-Internal-and-External-Linking) and paste it in that column.
* Share the link with us on the #product-ux channel on Slack!

### Tailwind prototypes (for more HTML/CSS-minded folks)

Another way to contribute is to create prototypes using our CSS library, [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). Our engineers will follow your HTML and CSS prototype very closely as they build out the UI. This is a great alternative to making pixel-perfect mockups if you're more proficient with HTML and CSS than with visual design tools.

To get started:

* Learn about Tailwind on [the website](https://tailwindcss.com) or [with this crash course](https://morioh.com/p/39832809fef8).
* Go through our [frontend introduction deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tPGOj26p1MzieN7vfTj4MhoAoytLWo4j78Us5Ku89x8/edit#slide=id.p), assembled by one of our core engineers.
* [Find an open Tailwind issue on GitHub](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/labels/tailwind-css) and comment that you'd like to take it on.
* [Copy this Tailwind playground](https://play.tailwindcss.com/JzARWTvFQP?file=css), which contains the basic styles and components that fit our style guidelines.
* Start editing the playground to create a prototype of what the page should look like. Check out the user story and mockup connected to the issue you took on to get a sense of what to build in.
* Once you're happy with your creation, copy the sharing link and paste it in the #tailwind channel on Slack to get feedback!

### Questions?

Feel free to ask questions to our team on the #product-ux or #tailwind channels on Slack. We'll try to get back to you as soon as we can.
