# Deploy system testing overview

## Code

Deployment related code can be found in
[civiform/cloud-deploy-infra](https://github.com/civiform/cloud-deploy-infra).

Scripts that a user would run are in
[civiform/civiform-deploy](https://github.com/civiform/civiform-deploy).

## Unit tests

Current unit test coverage is unknown but likely low. Select python files have
associated \_test.py tests. These tests are run on every pull request using the
[run_pytest](https://github.com/civiform/cloud-deploy-infra/blob/main/.github/workflows/run_pytest.yaml)
github action.

## End to end (e2e) tests

The current e2e testing implementation is the minimum viable setup. The
[end-to-end testing implementation decision
log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y1IFnuorFIsGJggMwJdLgAHtGMGPr9XDd8AdXH5VAlw/edit?usp=sharing)
contains details on each implementation decision made, different options
considered, and what decision was made. Most aspects of the implementation can
be iterated on to provide a more robust, secure, and developer-friendly e2e
testing framework. Each decision contains rational for when such iteration may
be worth the implementation and maintenance cost.

We currently run one e2e test every day at 1:23 UTC via GitHub actions. The
test runs the deploy tool in a dedicated testing AWS account. The action runs
[aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke) before and after the deploy
tool to clean the account.

### AWS e2e test account setup

There is currently one AWS account used for e2e tests. It is created under the
root CiviForm dev organization and named 'cloud-deploy-infra-tests-0'.

The account creation and configurations process was:

1. Created a new e2e test account in the CiviForm dev AWS organization.
2. Logged into the new account by switching roles into the default
   OrganizationAccountAccessRole role created in the new account.
3. Added an account alias for the new account.
4. Added an AWS Certificate Manager certificate in the new account.
5. Added the GitHub OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity provider to the new AWS
   account.
6. Added an e2e-test-runner role that can be assumed by entities provided by
   the GitHub OIDC provider (GitHub action runners).
7. Edited the e2e-test-runner role trust policy so that only GitHub action
   runners scoped to the civiform/cloud-deploy-infra main branch are allowed to
   assume the e2e-test-runner role.

Steps to create an additional test account:

#### Create a new e2e test account

1. Log in to the CiviForm dev AWS account and navigate to the ['AWS
   Organizations'
   page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2/home/root).

2. Determine the next test account number by looking at the
   'cloud-deploy-infra-tests-N' accounts in the 'cloud-deploy-infra-tests'
   organizational unit account list. For example, if there was only one account
   'cloud-deploy-infra-tests-0', the next test account number would be 1. If
   there were two accounts 'cloud-deploy-infra-tests-0' and
   'cloud-deploy-infra-tests-1', the next test account number would be 2.

	unit](../../../.gitbook/assets/account-list.png)

3. Click the 'Add an AWS account' button.

	![Add AWS account from AWS Organizations
	page](../../../.gitbook/assets/add-account.png)

4. Input the new account details:

   - 'AWS account name' field: input 'cloud-deploy-infra-tests-N' where N is
	 the next test account number.  For example, if the next test account
	 number was 2, input 'cloud-deploy-infra-tests-2'.
   - 'Email address of the account's owner' field: input
	 'cloud-deploy-infra-tests+N@civiform.dev' where N is the next test account
	 number. For example, if the next test account number was 2, input
	 'cloud-deploy-infra-tests+2@civiform.dev'.
   - 'IAM role name" field: leave the default of
	 'OrganizationAccountAccessRole'.

	details](../../../.gitbook/assets/add-account-details.png)

5. Click the 'Create AWS account' button. The account creation will take a
minute or two. Once it is created you will see it in the 'Organizational
structure' list on the ['AWS Organizations'
page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/organizations/v2/home/root)
page. **Copy the account number listed for the newly created account. You will
need it to log into the new account and configure it.**

6. Select the checkbox for the new account, click the 'Actions' button, then
click the 'Move' button under the 'AWS account' section in the dropdown.

	unit](../../../.gitbook/assets/move-account.png)

#### Log into a e2e test account

1. Click on the top-rightmost dropdown then click the 'Switch role' button.

2. Input the following details:

  - 'Account' field: input the account number you want to log in to.

3. Click the 'Switch Role' button.  You should now be viewing the newly created
account. To verify, navigate to the ['IAM
dashboard'](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?region=us-east-1#/home).
On the right sidebar, the 'Account ID' should match the account number of the
newly created account.

#### Configure a e2e test account

2. Click the 'Create' button next to the 'Account Alias' on the right sidebar.
Input 'civiform-cloud-deploy-infra-tests-N' where N is the next test account
number.  For example, if the next test account number was 2, input
'civiform-cloud-deploy-infra-tests-2'. The account alias is needed to run
aws-nuke on the account.

	![Add account alias](../../../.gitbook/assets/account-alias.png)

3. Navigate to the ['AWS Certificate Manager > Certificates > Request
certificate'
page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1#/certificates/request).
Keep the default 'Request a public certificate' option selected. Click the
'Next' button.

	page](../../../.gitbook/assets/request-cert.png)

4. Input the certificate details:

	- 'Fully qualified domain name' field: input 'cloud-deploy-infra-tests-N'
	  where N is the next test account number.  For example, if the next test
	  account number was 2, input 'civiform-cloud-deploy-infra-tests-2'.
	- 'Validation method' selection: keep the default selection of 'DNS
	  validation - recommended' selected.
	- 'Key algorithm' selection: keep the default selection of 'RSA 2048'
	  selected.

	![New certificate details](../../../.gitbook/assets/new-cert-details.png)

5. Click the 'Request' button.

6. You should be redirected to the ['AWS Certificate Manager > Certificates'
page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1#/certificates/list)
and there should be a banner at the top of the page that says 'Successfully
requested certificate with ID ...'.  Click the 'View certificate' button in the
banner.

	![Certificate request
	banner](../../../.gitbook/assets/view-cert-request.png)

7. In the 'Domains' section of the certificate detail page, there should be a
single row with 'CNAME' in the 'Type' column. The values in the 'CNAME name'
and 'CNAME value' columns are used to validate that we control the domain
(civiform.dev) requested by the certificate. Copy both the 'CNAME name' and
'CNAME value' column values, you will need them in the following steps.

	![CNAME validation values in certificate detail
	page](../../../.gitbook/assets/validation-details.png)

8. In a new tab, open the [civiform.dev DNS configuration
page](https://domains.google.com/registrar/civiform.dev/dns). Click the 'Manage
custom records' button in the 'Resource records > Custom records' box.

	![Manage custom records
	button](../../../.gitbook/assets/manage-records.png)

9. At the bottom of the list there should be empty inputs for a new record.
Input the following details:

	- 'Host name' field: input the value of the 'CNAME name' column. Remove the
	  '.civiform.dev' part at the end of the string. Google Domains
	  automatically appends this to whatever you enter. If you do not remove
	  it, you will add a CNAME record for
	  '<random_id>.cloud-deploy-infra-tests-N.civiform.dev.civiform.dev' which
	  is incorrect.
	- 'Type' selection: choose 'CNAME'.
	- 'TTL' field: leave the default of '3600'.
	- 'Data' field: input the value of the 'CNAME value' column.

validate the new CNAME record. Navigate to the ['AWS Certificate Manager >
Certificates'
page](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1#/certificates/list).
Once the validation has succeeded, the 'Status' column of the 'Certificates'
