# Communication Guidelines

These are the communication guidelines for the Civiform community,
including anyone interested in contributing to the open source project. 

  - **For announcements & recognition → email lists.** Why? Emails
    are accessible and universally used across organizations.
  - **For tracking work → GitHub.** Why? GitHub is our project
    management tool and should be the source of truth for ongoing work. 
  - **For all other communications → Slack.** Why? Slack is accessible
    across organizations and is useful for immediate conversations. 

## Google Groups

Google Groups enable people to post and engage in discussion topics via
forums or email. Certain Google Groups are also used to manage access to
shared documents. All group aliases are @googlegroups.com.

## Slack Channels

[**Slack**](https://civiform.slack.com) should be used by individuals
actively contributing to and / or maintaining CiviForm.

Note: If we find that collaborators at civic entities cannot use Slack,
we should reassess this approach.

[**civiform.slack.com**](https://civiform.slack.com)

Slack Norms:

  - Should add descriptions of purpose directly to channels in Slack.
  - Use threads to centralize discussions on a particular topic
  - Use @channel and @here judiciously
  - If you’ve never used Slack before, watch this [4 min intro
    video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=812kbhp0WdY) for the basics

## Shared Drive

NOTE: **If your Google Workspace domain (e.g. google.com) does not
allow you to create external documents, use and rename an existing
‘Untitled Document’ in the CiviForm Project Drive.**

  - Created through civiform.us Google Workspace.

    documents.

**[CiviForm Project Public Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1LT7ZivhjXb5iSxwisuF11CjUMKPYjpi0)**

  - **Sharing setting:** Anyone on the internet with this link can view
    and comment.
  - **Purpose:** For documents that are intended to be publicly visible
    and commentable.

**[CiviForm Project Private Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1svFQEY73YpI9k0-wyfqY2UU_w8hUFIAG)**

  - **Sharing setting:** Restricted. Only people in the
