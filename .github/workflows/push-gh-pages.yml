# Builds & pushes the `website/public` directory to the `gh-pages` branch.
#
# The 'main' branch of this repository is the source of truth for the website content.
#   The gh-pages branch contains the compiled html from running @11ty/eleventy
#   on the `main` branch, to serve that site content via GitHub pages.
#   The `gh-pages` branch should never be edited directly, and should always be
#   an exact mirror of running 'npm run build' and generating a  `website/public`
#   directory on the `main` branch. This workflow performs that build & mirror,
#   which then triggers the `gh-pages` branch to deploys the site content to GitHub Pages.
