# CiviForm Deployment system

TODO(#4324) Add a high level view of the deployment system here. Explain what each of the sub categories provides.

Before you start learning in depth about the deployment system, we recommend having a look at the [initial deployment instructions]{https://docs.civiform.us/it-manual/sre-playbook/initial-deployment} in the it-manual. The it-manual contains instructions for the operations teams who are in charge of deploying a system for a civic entity. Reading it first will allow you to start your learning from the users' perspective.
