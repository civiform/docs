# Create a Program

A CiviForm program is a benefits program built by CiviForm Admins. It’s essentially a vehicle to ask questions of program applicants and to collect completed applications. Once you create a program, you’ll need to publish it to make it available.

Watch the video to learn how to create a program in CiviForm. You can also follow the step-by-step guide below.

# Add or remove questions & screens in a program

## How to add screens and questions

CiviForm programs are made up of one or more questions housed in screens. Each program has a default screen.

A program can hold multiple screens and each screen should contain a logically themed set of questions (for example, all employment-related questions). Each screen equates to a new page when applying to a program.

You edit both unpublished and published programs. To edit published programs, you need a new version. For more details on versioning, go to [Manage versions for programs & questions](manage-versions-for-programs-and-questions.md).
