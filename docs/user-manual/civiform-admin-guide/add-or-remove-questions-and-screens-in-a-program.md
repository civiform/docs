# Add or remove questions & screens in a program

CiviForm programs are made up of one or more questions housed in screens. Each program has a default screen.

A program can hold multiple screens and each screen should contain a logically themed set of questions (for example, all employment-related questions). Each screen equates to a new page when applying to a program.

You edit both unpublished and published programs. To edit published programs, you need a new version. For more details on versioning, go to [Manage versions for programs & questions](manage-versions-for-programs-and-questions.md).

### Add a question to a screen

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Programs** on the navigation bar and select a program.
3. Click **Edit** > **Manage questions**.
4. Add a question to a screen by selecting it from the question bank.\
   The question appears within the screen.

**Note**: Enumerator or file upload questions must be the only questions on a screen. These question types cannot coexist with others. For example, if you add one of these questions to an empty screen, you can't add any other question types. If you have a screen that already has a question, you can't add an enumerator or file upload question to the screen.

### Remove a question from a screen

2. Click **Programs** on the navigation bar and select a program.
3. Click **Edit** > **Manage questions**.
4. Find the question within a screen you want to remove and click **Delete**.\
   The question is removed from the screen and it returns to the question bank.
