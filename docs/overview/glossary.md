* **Applicant**—Resident seeking to apply for government benefit programs.
* **Block**—Can be used interchangeably with _screen_.
* **CiviForm Admin**—Government staff that administer the tool. They set up CiviForm, create and manage questions, build program forms, and manage permissions for Trusted Intermediaries and Program Admins.
* **Enumerator screen**—Screens that contain an _enumerator question_ type. _Repeated screens_ can be created from enumerator screens to ask questions for each entity enumerated by the _applicant_.
* **Enumerator question**—A question type that allows _applicants_ to create a list of one type of entity. For example, household members, vehicles, jobs, etc.
* **Personally identifiable information (PII)**—Any data that could potentially identify a person, a corporation or other entity, or a browser or device by either (1) inspecting the data directly, or (2) joining the data with another widely available dataset.
* **Program Admin**—Government staff that administer a benefit program and handles applications for that program.
* **Question bank**—New questions added by a CiviForm Admin are saved in the global question bank. The CiviForm Admin can reuse the question in any program forms they build.
* **Repeated screen**—A program screen created from an _enumerator screen_ that contains _repeated questions_.
* **Repeated question**—A question associated with an _enumerator question_. A repeated question is asked for each entity enumerated by the applicant when they answer the _enumerator question_. A repeated question can be of any type, including an _enumerator question_. This can create nested _enumerator questions_ and later nested repeated questions. For example, an _enumerator question_ for household members could have a repeated dependent question for employment that’s also an enumerator. This allows for creating additional repeated questions about each employment role for each household member.
* **Screen**—A screen holds one or more questions. A program is made up of one or more screens. One screen is displayed at a time so screens can loosely be thought of as a single page within the form. Some screens can be repeated. Each program has one default screen.
* **Trusted Intermediary Group**—Community-Based Organization (CBOs) who help _applicants_ apply for benefit programs.
* **Trusted Intermediary**—Staff members of CBOs who interact with _applicants_.
