<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
  CiviForm is a powerful open source tool for civic entities and governments
  designed to simplify the administration of benefit programs, and make it
  easier for residents to access those benefits. It lets residents and community
  organizations find and apply to multiple services in one place. CiviForm also
  makes it easier for governments to administer their programs so they can
  better reach communities in need. CiviForm deployments will be most successful
  if:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your CiviForm deployment has an owner and champion.</li>
  <li>
    You can decide early as to which will be the first program(s) you will
    deploy on CiviForm.
  </li>
  <li>You can simplify and optimize your program applications.</li>
  <li>You can simplify how you process and follow up on applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  To ensure a successful CiviForm implementation, read through the brief guide
  below and create your plan to build programs.
</p>
<h2>Understanding Your Needs and Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      [ ] <strong>Define user needs:</strong> To create program forms that
      people will find intuitive and easy to use, consider the needs of both
      your residents and program administrators.<br />
      - [ ] Spend time to understand how your residents interact with the
      program applications so that you can optimize the experience of CiviForm
      users (including residents and administrators):<br />

  <li>
    <p>
      [ ] <strong>Choose programs to put in CiviForm:</strong> Determine which
      programs will benefit most from using CiviForm (e.g., benefit
      applications, complaint forms, event registrations, permit
      applications).<br />
      - [ ] Evaluate programs most likely to benefit from CiviForm by using
      these resources:<br />

      - [ ] Examine selected programs to identify opportunities to streamline
      overlapping questions:<br />
      - [ ] Review the information gathered on the application for each program
      and remove any unnecessary questions.<br />
      - [ ] Work with program stakeholders including program administrators to
      understand the administrative and policy requirements for different
      programs.<br />
      - [ ] Identify common questions across programs (Ex. Name, Address,
      income).<br />
      - [ ] Explore ways to consolidate these questions to streamline reuse.<br />
      - [ ] Consider creating a “Common Intake” form as a “Get Started”.<br />
      - [ ] For each program:<br />
      - [ ] Decide on who the program leader/owner and primary point of contact
      will be.<br />
      - [ ] Decide how applications to the program will be reviewed. Will they
      be reviewed in CiviForm, or pulled into an external system? If an external
      system, identify the technical PoCs.

<h2>Preparation for Launch</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    [ ] Review the
    <a
      href="https://docs.civiform.us/user-manual/civiform-admin-guide/working-with-programs/create-a-program"
      >form building how-to-guide</a
    >
    to begin building your first program<br />
    - [ ] User-centric design: Create forms that are easy to understand and
    complete, using <a href="http://plainlanguage.gov">plain language</a>.<br />
    - [ ] Keep accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG) in mind when creating your
    forms.<br />
    - [ ] Consider which languages Program questions and answers will be
    translated to and which languages
    <a
      href="https://docs.civiform.us/user-manual/civiform-admin-guide/manage-translations-for-programs-and-questions"
      >CiviForm supports natively</a
    >.<br />
    - [ ] Find translation resources and add time for translations to your
    project timeline.<br />
    - [ ] Data validation: Implement program checks (such as phone number
    formats and hints to users “select only two choices” to prevent errors and
    ensure data accuracy.<br />
    - [ ] Work with your IT team to select an identity and authentication
    provider (i.e. Login.gov).
  </li>
  <li>
    [ ] Identify the list of relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and
    metrics to identify what a successful launch would look like for each
    program launch. Example metrics:<br />
    - [ ] Reduction in time to complete an application.<br />
    - [ ] Increase in residents’ access to annual savings / benefits
    (dollars).<br />
    - [ ] Increase in number of programs online / added to CiviForm.
  </li>
  <li>
    [ ] Identify key stakeholders throughout the community (eg. CBOs) and local
    governments who might be able to connect target user groups with the program
    to ensure a successful launch.
  </li>
  <li>
    [ ] If resident applications are managed or reviewed in an external case
    management system, work with your technical team to ensure necessary data
    pipelines are set up and tested.
  </li>
  <li>
    [ ] Develop a plan for thorough testing: Conduct comprehensive testing to
    identify and fix issues before launch.
  </li>
  <li>
    [ ] Train program administrators how to use CiviForm and how to route
    questions / issues they have.
  </li>
  <li>
    [ ] Perform user experience studies.<br />
    - [ ] Ensure that at least 10 real end users have tested the new program.<br />
    - [ ] Work with specific programs to test the end-to-end process for
    application submission and processing and make adjustments as needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    [ ] Pilot program: Plan a pilot launch to gather feedback and make
    improvements.
  </li>
  <li>
    [ ] Decide on launch announcement plans to ensure that residents can find
    and apply for the new streamlined programs.<br />
    - [ ] Identify target audience/user group, communication channels (eg. press
    release, website announcement, social media posts, a newsletter) to share
    the news with residents.<br />
    - [ ] Develop a communication plan: Inform citizens and stakeholders about
    the new system and its benefits and consider how you may drive awareness
    about the program.<br />
    - [ ] Consider relevant metrics to measure if you are reaching your
    residents.
  </li>
  <li>
    [ ] Generate excitement by recording demos and sharing any initial findings,
    positive data outcomes, or testimonials resulting from use of CiviForm to
    connect users to the program.
  </li>
  <li>[ ] <strong>Announce CiviForm to your community</strong></li>
  <li>
    [ ] Put ample opportunities for feedback in place during and after the
    launch so that users can flag any questions or bugs.
  </li>
  <li>
    [ ] If programs will be rolled out in phases, provide users with a timeline
    of future planned launches for additional programs.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Next steps - Ongoing Evaluation and Improvement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    [ ] Performance metrics: Track key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure
    the impact of CiviForm.
  </li>
  <li>
    [ ] User feedback: Gather feedback from citizens and staff to identify areas
    for improvement.
  </li>
  <li>
    [ ] Iterative development: Continuously update and refine forms based on
    user needs and data analysis.
  </li>
  <li>[ ] Continue to grow CiviForm, adding new programs over time.</li>
