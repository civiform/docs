# Testing resources

### Testing resources

Product managers, user experience designers, and others may need to test out CiviForm to see how the product currently looks and works. Recall that there are 4 user types:

* Applicants
* Trusted intermediaries (TIs)
* CiviForm admins
* Program admins

Logging in as applicants, CiviForm admins, Program admins, or TIs is pretty easy -- there should be buttons for those directly on [[staging.seattle.civiform.com](https://staging.seattle.civiform.com)](https://staging-aws.civiform.dev):

* Applicants: choose "Continue as guest"
* CiviForm admins: choose "CiviForm Admin" or "Program and CiviForm Admin"
* Program admins: choose "Program Admin" or "Program and CiviForm Admin"
* TIs: choose "Trusted Intermediary"
