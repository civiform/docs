**How do I become a CiviForm Admin?**

CiviForm Admins are controlled by a group configured in the admin identity provider. When a person logs in via the admin flow, CiviForm checks if the user belongs to the configured admin group. If so, the user is granted CiviForm Admin privileges.

More about admin authentication setup in [Authentication Providers guide](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/wiki/Authentication-Providers).
