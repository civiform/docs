# Initial Deployment

This guide is for SREs or DevOps folks. It explains how to do an initial deployment of CiviForm into your production cloud environment. CiviForm has the following deployment options:

* Can be deployed into AWS using [Terraform](terraform-deploy-system.md).
* Can be deployed into Azure using [Terraform](terraform-deploy-system.md).
* Can be custom deployed using in cloud or on prem using [CiviForm docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/civiform/civiform) directly. Requires more configuration and maintainance. 
* _In the future, GCP support will likely be added._
