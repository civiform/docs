# CiviForm server environment variables

We document every environment variable that the CiviForm server reads
configuration from in
[env-var-docs.json](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/blob/main/server/conf/env-var-docs.json).
When we create a new CiviForm release a corresponding markdown file is
generated from env-var-docs.json and added to this directory.
