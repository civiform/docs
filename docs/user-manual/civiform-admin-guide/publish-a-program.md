### Publish all draft programs

Once a program is created or a new version is launched, the program remains in draft until published. When published, it’s available to both Trusted Intermediaries and Applicants.

There can only be one unpublished version in the system at a time and once a version is published, it’s locked and cannot be modified. For more details on versioning, go to [Manage versions for programs & questions.](manage-versions-for-programs-and-questions.md)

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Programs** on the navigation bar.
3. Click **Publish all drafts**.\
   Any new or versioned program is now available.
