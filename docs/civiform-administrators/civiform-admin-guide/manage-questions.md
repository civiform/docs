# Manage Questions

Questions form the structure of a CiviForm program. When a CiviForm Admin creates a question for one of their forms, the question is saved in the global question bank. When programs reuse the same question, all Applicant data related to the question gets autofilled. This reduces duplicate data entry and ensures accuracy by using previously vetted information.

### Create a question

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Questions** on the navigation bar.
3. Click **Create new question** and select a question type.\
   For more details on question types, go to [Question types](https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/wiki/Manage-questions#question-types).
4. Enter the information for the question.
5. Click **Create**.\
   The new question appears in the list of questions.

**Tip**: You might want to develop a naming convention for your questions. For example, address-residence, address-work, etc.

### Edit a question

You can edit both unpublished and published questions. To edit published questions, you need a new version. For more details on versioning, go to [Manage versions for programs & questions](https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/wiki/Manage-versions-for-programs-&-questions).

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Questions** on the navigation bar and select a question.
3. Click **Edit draft**.
4. Modify the question information fields.
5. Click **Update**.

### Archive a question

If a question is no longer in use by any program, you can archive a question.

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Questions** on the navigation bar and select a question.
3. Click **Archive**.

### Restore an archived question

When you restore an archived question, you can use it in your programs. You can restore an archived question up until the next version is published. For more details on versioning, go to [Manage versions for programs & questions](https://github.com/seattle-uat/civiform/wiki/Manage-versions-for-programs-&-questions).

1. Sign in to CiviForm as a CiviForm Admin.
2. Click **Questions** on the navigation bar and select an archived question.
3. Click **Restore archived**.

### Question types

You can customize your program to include multiple different question types. The table below shows the supported question types, along with the expected data input.
