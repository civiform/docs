# CiviForm server environment variables

The CiviForm server is configurable through environment variables. All
availabile variables are documented in a
[env-var-docs.json](https://github.com/civiform/civiform/blob/main/server/conf/env-var-docs.json)
file in the civiform/civiform repository.

When a CiviForm server version is released, the env-var-docs.json file
corresponding to the release is used to generate markdown documentation of the
variables. The generated markdown files are added to this directoy. Use the
left sidebar to see the available configuration variables for the CiviForm
version you are deploying.
