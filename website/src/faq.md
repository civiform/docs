    <summary>How much does CiviForm cost?</summary>
    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p>CiviForm’s software is free and open source; however, setting up CiviForm in your community requires a significant organizational investment in civic service design to ensure programs and residents have an improved experience, and operating CiviForm requires ongoing staff time to manage questions and application forms. Additionally, there are <a href="https://docs.civiform.us/it-manual/infrastructure-requirements">infrastructure costs</a> associated with hosting CiviForm using in-house resources or a third party.</p>

    <summary>What technical capacity is necessary to deploy and manage CiviForm?</summary>
    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p>CiviForm is open source software that can be deployed and self-hosted on each government’s own cloud or on-premises infrastructure. Existing IT staff with knowledge of cloud or on-premises systems can <a href="https://docs.civiform.us/it-manual/sre-playbook/initial-deployment">set up and manage CiviForm with minimal effort</a>. Once CiviForm is deployed, non-technical users can manage programs and questions through a user-friendly interface.

    <summary>Why is CiviForm built as open source software?</summary>
    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p>CiviForm is built as a <a href="https://softwarecollaborative.org/">government software collaborative</a>, which provides a way of co-developing and maintaining shared government software that reduces long-term maintenance costs and makes it easier to adapt to the changing needs of programs and communities. CiviForm’s open source approach is grounded in principles of transparency, community ownership, and community-driven development. Member organizations contribute to CiviForm’s shared codebase through collective planning and decision-making processes (read about CiviForm’s governance processes <a href="https://docs.civiform.us/governance-and-management/governance">here</a>).</p>

    <summary>Are open source tools like CiviForm secure?</summary>
    <div class="accordion-body">
    <p>Yes. Open source software is widely used across critical web infrastructure, including by secure government services such as <a href="https://github.com/18F/identity-idp">Login.gov</a>. CiviForm’s maintainers regularly update software dependencies and publish a new release each week. CiviForm’s approach to open source software development is inspired by best practices from technical government organizations such as <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/open-source-policy/">18F</a>.</p>
