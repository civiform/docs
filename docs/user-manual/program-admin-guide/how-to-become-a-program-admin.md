# How to become a Program Admin

Program admins have access only to applications of programs they were assigned to. Assignments controlled by CiviForm admins on per-program basis. If Alice (alice@mycity.gov) needs access to applications of program "Solar program":

1. CiviForm Admin need to go to Programs list and click "Manage Program Admins" on "Solar program". Then add `alice@mycity.gov` as admin.
2. Alice needs to log in to CiviForm using "Admin login" flow. Logging in using applicant flow won't work.
